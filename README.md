# Angular Scaffolding Template: Power up your Angular projects! 💪🚀

Welcome to the Angular Scaffolding Template! This template provides a solid structure for your Angular projects, making development a breeze. Inspired by [Shijin Nath's article](https://medium.com/@shijin_nath/angular-right-file-structure-and-best-practices-that-help-to-scale-2020-52ce8d967df5), we've created a setup with Core, Features, and Shared modules to accommodate to any project type.

## What's Included?

1. Core Module: The powerhouse of your app, providing essential services and utilities.
2. Features Module: Create separate modules for different features or sections of your app.
3. Shared Module: Share reusable components, directives, and pipes across modules.

Get started with this friendly and organized Angular template. Happy coding! 🎉👩‍💻👨‍💻
